General plan: 
- Design a database scheme with the following entities:
    = Album

    = Photo 
    = User and Order
- Develop models based on the DB scheme
- Create and run simple tests for models
- Designing the following screens:
    = Welcome screen
    = Registeration 
    = Login 
    = Dashboard which contains the album list and order history
    = Album editor
    = Album viewer
    = Order placement
    = Profile editor
- Developing templates based on the screens designed
- Designing the templates for albums slides
- Developing the back-end logic including the following features:
    = User's authentication (login, logout, register)
    = Automatic e-mailing (registration confirmation, order confirmation, etc)
    = Album logic (create, delete, edit, share, etc)
    = Order logic (create, pay, finalize, cancel)
    = Social media sharing
- Create and run tests for the back-end logic
- Design improvements (Twitter Bootstrap)
- Additional logic:
