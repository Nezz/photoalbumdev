Guidelines
==========

When contributing to the project, please do not commit directly to the main repository. Make pull request from your own fork instead. This allows team members to work independently and discuss pull request. This makes it easier to follow the changes in the project. A pull request should be merged by someone else who should review the code. If there are issues with the pull request (does not compile, fails some tests, etc) the pull request should not be merged until it has been updated with a fix.

Submitting Patches
==================

The process for making a pull request is generally as follows:

1. Make a feature branch from `master` for the change.
2. Edit, build and test the feature.
3. Commit to your local repository.
4. Push the feature branch to your GitHub fork.
5. Create the pull request.

If you need to make changes to the pull request, simply repeat steps 2-4.  Adding commits to that feature branch in your fork will automatically add the change to the pull request.

Once a pull request has been accepted, your feature branch can be deleted if desired.
